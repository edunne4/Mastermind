# Mastermind

Mastermind is a fun and easy to play Model for people age 3 to 103. In this version of MasterMind, users can interface with a beautifully designed Controller and play against a CPU. Users can also alter the difficulty of the Model to their personal play style by adjusting the number of turns per Model and/or the number of pegs per turn.

Playing a Model is simple. Click on the piece you would like to select, and drop it on the playable row. Once you have completed your turn, simply submit your turn and watch the scoring pegs populate. Once the Model is over, a dialog box will display a "YOU WON" or a "YOU LOST" message.

While this is a simple Model, it is, without a doubt, the best Model on the market. Good luck and have fun!
